# The Internet
## Internet and how it works

At a very basic scale, two devices communication through a LAN cable forms a network, and the **Internet** is an enourmous network of  such networks in different scales. The Internet is a combination of:

* **Physical network infrastructure** such as routers, switches, cables, modems.
* **Protocols** enabling a functioning infrastructure.

Types of devices communicating over Internet and the software these devices use vary a lot. There are other physical devices that are part of the physical infrastructure which are also connected to Internet. We use protocols within a layered system of communication to ensure:

* Data is transferred from one device to another
* Devices can access World Wide Web.

## Latency, Bandwidth and other characteristics of physical network

* **Latency** is **the amount of time** that it takes for data to travel from one point to another.
  To determine the overall latency of a network connection we measure delay. There are different types of delay, sum of which defines the 
  total latency. (Propagation delay, Transmission delay, Processing delay, Queuing delay)
* **Bandwidth** is **the amount of data** that can be transferred from a device at once.
* **Bit rate** is **the amount of bits** that can be transferred by a device over a given period of time.
* A **Network hop** is the transfer of data from one node to another.
* **Nodes** are network devices that process the data and pass it forward to the next node on the path.
